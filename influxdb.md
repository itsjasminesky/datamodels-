InfluxDB which can be found at https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/ is both an open source and commercial database product. Beyond the
scope of the course and the other models i've discussed InfluxDB utalizes a time-series data model handling large amounts of hand stamped data. This is 
optimal for the handling of data which changes over time such as stock prices. 
It uses a client/server hosting model and can be accessed using Python and Java using the native client libraires using InfluxDBClientFactory Class's create() method.
